# Mock Me

> Mock Me is a web service to build mock responses while backend developers are still deving away.
> This gives you the ability to keep your applications abstracted away from direct mock data in the form of JSON files etc.  
> When your web service is ready simply swap out your mock me URL for the real deal.
